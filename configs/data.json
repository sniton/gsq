The environmental impact of synthetic refrigerants has prompted retailers to turn to natural fluids. Ammonia, together with a cooling medium which produces positive cooling, is usually combined with a cascade CO2 unit for negative refrigeration. The CO2/NH3 duo is the ideal solution for the efficient production of cooling with a limited carbon impact, since greenhouse gas emissions are cut by 80%. CO2 can also be used alone thanks to transcritical technology.
